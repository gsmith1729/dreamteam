SLEEPER HACKATHON 2018

# dreamteam

We believe sleep is a huge influence to our bodies so our purpose is for us to ensure you get your good night sleep.

This platform works by monitoring your sleep after the clicking the bed on the front page (which the user clicks to say they're sleeping) via noise levels which detect movement around the phone.

The app contains your own personalised account which contains your sleep data as well as trends. It will contain your achievements which can be gained by simple tasks. Lastly, there will be a competitive aspect in the form of leaderboards. As teenagers seem to be very active in competition we believe the leaderboards encourage them to beat their friends just by sleeping and in that way they'll make the app a part of their daily routine.
